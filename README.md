# 11ty personal blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/930a7acf-5cfd-41a7-a38d-d5b80da959c2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/raphaelferrand/deploys)

This is intended to be for a personal blog, simple, performant, focusing on content, a static site as it gets.
It's also a way to play around, experimenting with new cool stuff away from production codebase ;-)

## How to start 🔧

- clone the repo
- type "eleventy --serve" to flip on a local dev
- check at [http://localhost/8080](http://localhost:8080/)
- type "eleventy" to build the static site

## How to contribute 💪

We'll see later, what if I open this theme as 11ty starter ... ?
