# 11ty personal blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/930a7acf-5cfd-41a7-a38d-d5b80da959c2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/raphaelferrand/deploys)

This is intended to be for a personal blog, simple, performant, focusing on content, a static site as it gets.
It's also a way to play around, experimenting with new cool stuff away from production codebase ; -)

## How to start üîß

* clone the repo
* type "npm run start" to run it locally
* check at [http://localhost/3000](http://localhost:3000/)
* type "eleventy" to build the static site

## How to contribute üí™

We'll see later, what if I open this theme as 11ty starter ... ?
